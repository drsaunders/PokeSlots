How I used Reinforcement Learning to Beat the Slots in Pokémon

Now written up in a [Towards Data Science blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-i-beat-the-slots-in-pok%C3%A9mon-using-reinforcement-learning-81502e9d6be7)!

[This is a notebook](https://github.com/drsaunders/PokeSlots/blob/main/PokeSlots.ipynb) about **MACHAMP: Multi-Armed Coin Holdings Amplifier Made for Pokémon**, which is a Thompson-sampling multi-armed bandit agent I used to win a lot of coins at the Celadon Game Corner in Pokémon FireRed. Lots of credit to Lilian Weng for her [excellent tutorial](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2018/01/23/the-multi-armed-bandit-problem-and-its-solutions.html) and for [her code](https://github.com/lilianweng/multi-armed-bandit) that I started from (everything in the "multi_armed_bandit" package).
